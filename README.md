# OpenFOAM-Documentation
 Installation and Regression Testing of OpenFOAM 

 OpenFOAM is a C++ toolbox for the development of customized numerical solvers, and pre-/post-processing utilities for the solution of continuum mechanics problems, most prominently including computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 
 
 **Scope** It is used in research organizations, academic institutes and across many types of industries, for example, automotive, manufacturing, process engineering and environmental engineering. 
 
**Purpose** The goals of this project are 1) to install recent versions of OpenFOAM on the Uni.lu HPC platform using EasyBuild, and 2) to set up a regression testing configuration for the installed OpenFOAM using ReFrame.
